# inventorium
A basic inventory system written in Python that creates and stores item data in a MySQL database, using the MySQL Connector Python library. Also uses the built-in Cmd library from Python to create a command line interface.
Each item has an auto-incrementing id, name, quantity, cost, and description.
The system automatically creates the necessary tables and database, requiring an account with access to the following commands: CREATE, SELECT, INSERT, and UPDATE.
